<h1> The Best Movies According to Salma </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all time. </h2>
<hr>
<h3> Barbie </h3>
    <p> It's Barbie. Duh.</p>
<h3> Oppenheimer </h3>
    <p> This movie was really long and depressing to watch but was shot really well. I do think it kind of romanticized a very traumatic history though.</p>
<h3> The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes </h3>
    <p> I love, love, love, this whole franchise. 10/10 always.</p>
